# Demos

## consumer.py

This demo reads from an event topic using the `DigitizerEventListMessage` generated from the corresponding [flatbuffers schema](https://github.com/STFC-ICD-Research-and-Design/supermusr-data-pipeline/blob/main/schemas/dev1_digitizer_event_v1.fbs). The metadata and event list sizes are then printed to the console.
